This involves:\n","1. Setting up a GAN architecture that incorporates embeddings.\n","2. Training the GAN to generate high-quality synthetic embeddings or data.\n","3. Evaluating the GAN's performance using relevant metrics.\n","\n","## Key Steps\n","\n","### 1. Define GAN Architecture\n","- **Generator**: Accepts embeddings and noise as inputs, producing synthetic data.\n","- **Discriminator**: Evaluates the authenticity of generated data, optionally conditioned on embeddings.\n","\n","### 2. Load Pre-Generated Embeddings\n","- Load embeddings created in Plan 1 from their respective directories.\n","- Normalize and preprocess embeddings for GAN training.\n","\n","### 3. Train the GAN\n","- Set up training loops for the generator and discriminator.\n","- Use appropriate loss functions, such as adversarial loss (e.g., Wasserstein loss).\n","- Optionally, include auxiliary tasks (e.g., reconstruction loss) for better embedding alignment.\n","\n","### 4. Save Outputs\n","- Save trained GAN models.\n","- Save generated embeddings or data for downstream evaluation.\n","\n","### 5. Evaluate GAN Performance\n","- Use metrics like FID, IS, and qualitative visualization.\n","- Compare performance with baseline models or methods.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Starting Point\n","\n","**Files Available**:\n","- `plan2_gan_models.py`: Contains the GAN architecture.\n","- `plan2_gan_training.py`: Implements the training pipeline.\n","- `main_plan2_gan_training.ipynb`: High-level control notebook.\n","- `plan2_experiments.ipynb`: For experimentation and evaluation.\n","\n","## Next Steps\n","1. **Review Architecture**:\n","   - Inspect `plan2_gan_models.py` to understand the generator and discriminator setup.\n","2. **Pipeline Setup**:\n","   - Review and prepare the training pipeline in `plan2_gan_training.py`.\n","3. **Experimentation**:\n","   - Use `plan2_experiments.ipynb` for controlled experiments.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":56372,"status":"ok","timestamp":1738309948485,"user":{"displayName":"Farshad H","userId":"17155898055621377416"},"user_tz":-210},"id":"i3fgL_75bNh_","outputId":"1d619183-62db-4f78-b838-24b158db03dc"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n","Current working directory: /content/drive/MyDrive/GAN-thesis-project\n","Using device: cpu\n"]}],"source":["# Plan 2 GAN Training Notebook\n","\n","import os\n","import sys\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import torch\n","import torch.optim as optim\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","import logging\n","import json\n","import datetime\n","from datetime import datetime\n","from torchvision import datasets, transforms\n","from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset, random_split\n","from torchvision.models import inception_v3\n","from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n","from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors\n","from scipy.linalg import sqrtm\n","from scipy.stats import wasserstein_distance, entropy, spearmanr, gaussian_kde\n","\n","\n","from google.colab import drive\n","\n","# Mount Google Drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","\n","# Repository path (adjust if needed)\n","repo_path = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/GAN-thesis-project\"\n","\n","# Add repository path to sys.path for module imports\n","if repo_path not in sys.path:\n","    sys.path.append(repo_path)\n","\n","# Change working directory to the repository\n","os.chdir(repo_path)\n","\n","# Verify the working directory\n","print(f\"Current working directory: {os.getcwd()}\")\n","\n","\n","# Set random seed and device\n","SEED = 42\n","torch.manual_seed(SEED)\n","np.random.seed(SEED)\n","device = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\n","print(f\"Using device: {device}\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4657,"status":"ok","timestamp":1738309966176,"user":{"displayName":"Farshad H","userId":"17155898055621377416"},"user_tz":-210},"id":"WMNOlaoUC4c7","outputId":"1229c6ec-8d45-4336-c394-d788b4e9192f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Module: src.data_utils\n","  Functions:\n","    -

In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.
